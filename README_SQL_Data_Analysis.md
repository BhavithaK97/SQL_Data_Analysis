# SQL Data Analysis

This repository contains the work completed as part of my **internship task** on SQL data analysis.

## Project Overview

- This project involves analyzing a sample dataset using SQL queries.  
- I wrote various SQL queries to explore and extract insights from the data.  
- Screenshots are included to show the execution of these queries and their results.

## Repository Contents

- `Bhavitha_Task4_Queries.txt` — SQL queries used for data analysis.  
- `Table_Structure.sql` — SQL file containing the table creation scripts and schema definitions.  
- Multiple screenshots (`Query1.jpg`, `Query2.jpg`, etc.) — Images showing query outputs.  
- `README.md` — This file, describing the project.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Table_Structure.sql` file to create the database tables with the correct schema.  
2. Open the `Bhavitha_Task4_Queries.txt` file to review all SQL queries.  
3. View the screenshots to see the results of running these queries.  
4. You can use or modify these queries and table structures for your own learning or projects.

## About the Dataset

- The dataset used is a sample dataset utilized for practicing SQL data analysis.  
- It simulates real-world scenarios for educational purposes.
